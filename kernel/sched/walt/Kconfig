	depends on SMP
	help
	This feature will allow the scheduler to maintain a tunable window
	based set of metrics for tasks and runqueues. These metrics can be
	used to guide task placement as well as task frequency requirements
	for cpufreq governors.

	tristate "WALT debug module"
	select TRACE_PREEMPT_TOGGLE
	select TRACE_IRQFLAGS
	help
	  This module provides the means of debugging long preempt and
	  irq disable code. This helps in identifying the scheduling
	  latencies. The module rely on preemptirq trace hooks and
	  print the stacktrace to the ftrace upon long preempt and irq
	  events. Sysctl knobs are available for the user to configure
	  the thresholds.

	  This module also used to crash the system to catch issues
	  in scenarios like RT throttling and sleeping while in atomic
	  context etc.
